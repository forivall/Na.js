Na.js
====

Takes a mostly new approach to control flow, yet is built upon the existing concepts, such as dependancy injection.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/forivall/na.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/forivall/na)



## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install na`

```javascript
var na = require('na');
na(...);
```

## Documentation
Currently, Na.js is a facade to `async.auto`, that reduces the need to repeat and unpack arguments.

## Examples
See the test file for now. (not passing)
